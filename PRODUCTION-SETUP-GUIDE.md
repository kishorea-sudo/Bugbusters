# 🚀 Complete Production Setup Guide - NexaFlow

## Overview
This guide will help you set up NexaFlow with **8 production team members** and proper workflow where:
- ✅ **Admin creates projects** and assigns them to PM
- ✅ **PM sees assigned projects** in dashboard  
- ✅ **PM breaks down projects** into tasks for team members
- ✅ **Team members see only their assigned tasks** (proper isolation)
- ✅ **Project complexity determines team size** (2-5 members per project)

## 🔄 Step 1: Create Production Users in Supabase

### **Go to Supabase Authentication Dashboard:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**  
3. Click **"Add user"** for each user below

### **Create These 8 Users (in order):**

```
1. admin@nexaflow.com         (Password: NexaFlow2025!Admin)
2. pm@nexaflow.com           (Password: NexaFlow2025!PM)  
3. senior.dev@nexaflow.com   (Password: NexaFlow2025!Senior)
4. frontend.dev@nexaflow.com (Password: NexaFlow2025!Frontend)
5. backend.dev@nexaflow.com  (Password: NexaFlow2025!Backend)
6. designer@nexaflow.com     (Password: NexaFlow2025!Design)
7. qa@nexaflow.com          (Password: NexaFlow2025!QA)
8. devops@nexaflow.com      (Password: NexaFlow2025!DevOps)
```

### **Important Notes:**
- ✅ Use **exact emails** above (they appear in login dropdown)
- ✅ Use **exact passwords** above (strong production passwords)
- ✅ Enable **email confirmation** if desired
- ❌ Don't use demo passwords like "demo123"

---

## 🗄️ Step 2: Get User UUIDs

### **After creating all users, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users ORDER BY email;
```

### **Copy the UUIDs** - you'll need them for the next step.

---

## 📋 Step 3: Run Production Setup Script

### **Open the setup script:**
- File: `backend/production-workflow-setup.sql`

### **Replace UUID placeholders:**
1. **Find these placeholders** in the script:
   ```sql
   'ADMIN_UUID'     → Replace with admin@nexaflow.com UUID
   'PM_UUID'        → Replace with pm@nexaflow.com UUID  
   'SENIOR_UUID'    → Replace with senior.dev@nexaflow.com UUID
   'FRONTEND_UUID'  → Replace with frontend.dev@nexaflow.com UUID
   'BACKEND_UUID'   → Replace with backend.dev@nexaflow.com UUID
   'DESIGNER_UUID'  → Replace with designer@nexaflow.com UUID
   'QA_UUID'        → Replace with qa@nexaflow.com UUID
   'DEVOPS_UUID'    → Replace with devops@nexaflow.com UUID
   ```

2. **Example replacement:**
   ```sql
   -- BEFORE:
   ('ADMIN_UUID', 'admin@nexaflow.com', 'System', 'Administrator'...)
   
   -- AFTER:  
   ('a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890', 'admin@nexaflow.com', 'System', 'Administrator'...)
   ```

### **Run the complete script** in Supabase SQL Editor

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Setup

### **Test the workflow:**

1. **Go to your app:** `http://localhost:5174` (or 5173)

2. **Login as Admin:**
   - Email: `admin@nexaflow.com`
   - Password: `NexaFlow2025!Admin`
   - ✅ Should see admin dashboard with project creation
   - ✅ Should see 5 created projects assigned to PM

3. **Login as Project Manager:**
   - Email: `pm@nexaflow.com` 
   - Password: `NexaFlow2025!PM`
   - ✅ Should see PM dashboard with assigned projects
   - ✅ Should see task management section
   - ✅ Should see created tasks assigned to team members

4. **Login as Team Members:**
   - Try any team member account (senior.dev@nexaflow.com, etc.)
   - ✅ Should see only THEIR assigned tasks
   - ✅ Should NOT see other team members' tasks
   - ✅ Should see proper task details and project context

---

## 🏗️ Step 5: Understanding the Workflow

### **Admin → PM → Team Member Flow:**

```
📊 ADMIN LEVEL:
├── Creates projects for clients
├── Assigns ALL projects to PM  
└── Assigns team members to projects (2-5 per project based on complexity)

👨‍💼 PM LEVEL:
├── Receives project assignments from admin
├── Sees all assigned projects in dashboard
├── Breaks down projects into specific tasks
├── Assigns tasks to team members based on skills
└── Manages workload distribution

👩‍💻 TEAM MEMBER LEVEL:
├── Sees only THEIR assigned tasks
├── Cannot see other team members' tasks (privacy/isolation)
├── Receives notifications for new task assignments
└── Updates task progress (flows back to PM)
```

### **Project Complexity Examples:**

```
🔥 COMPLEX PROJECTS (4-5 team members):
└── Enterprise Web Platform: Senior Dev, Frontend, Backend, Designer, QA

⚡ MEDIUM PROJECTS (2-3 team members):  
└── Healthcare System: Backend, Frontend, QA

💡 SIMPLE PROJECTS (2 team members):
└── Learning Platform: Frontend, Backend
```

## 🎯 Step 6: Login Order & User Display

### **The 8 users appear everywhere in this exact order:**

```
1. 👑 admin@nexaflow.com         (System Administrator)
2. 🎯 pm@nexaflow.com           (Project Manager)  
3. 🏆 senior.dev@nexaflow.com   (Senior Developer)
4. 🎨 frontend.dev@nexaflow.com (Frontend Developer)
5. ⚙️ backend.dev@nexaflow.com  (Backend Developer)
6. 🎨 designer@nexaflow.com     (UI/UX Designer)
7. 🧪 qa@nexaflow.com          (QA Engineer)
8. 🚀 devops@nexaflow.com      (DevOps Engineer)
```

### **Quick Login Feature:**
- ✅ Login page shows all 8 users in dropdown
- ✅ Click any user to auto-fill credentials  
- ✅ No need to type emails/passwords manually
- ✅ Consistent ordering across entire application

---

## 🔒 Step 7: Security & Privacy Features

### **Data Isolation:**
- ✅ Team members see only THEIR tasks
- ✅ Clients see only THEIR projects
- ✅ PM sees all assigned projects and team tasks
- ✅ Admin sees everything

### **Role-Based Access:**
- ✅ Admin: Full project creation and team management
- ✅ PM: Project and task management for assigned projects
- ✅ Team Members: Task execution and progress updates  
- ✅ Clients: Project viewing and communication with PM

### **Workflow Enforcement:**
- ✅ Only admin can create projects
- ✅ Only PM can break down projects into tasks
- ✅ Only PM can assign tasks to team members
- ✅ Team members update → PM → Client communication flow

## 📊 Step 8: Testing Scenarios

### **Test Admin Workflow:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Projects section  
3. Create a new project
4. Assign it to PM
5. Assign 2-4 team members based on complexity
6. Verify PM receives notification

### **Test PM Workflow:**  
1. Login as PM
2. See assigned projects in dashboard
3. Go to Team/Task Management
4. Break down project into tasks
5. Assign tasks to specific team members
6. Verify team members receive notifications

### **Test Team Member Workflow:**
1. Login as any team member
2. See only YOUR assigned tasks  
3. Verify you cannot see other members' tasks
4. Update task status
5. Verify update flows to PM

### **Test User Isolation:**
1. Login as different team members
2. Confirm each sees different task lists
3. Confirm no cross-visibility of tasks
4. Confirm proper project context

- ✅ PM creates tasks → Team member dashboards show only their tasks  
- ✅ Team sizes match project complexity (2-5 members)
- ✅ All 8 users appear in consistent order everywhere
- ✅ No demo data or placeholder content
- ✅ Strong production passwords (not demo123)
- ✅ Proper role-based access control
- ✅ Task isolation between team members

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Login Doesn't Work:**
1. Check user was created in Supabase Auth dashboard
2. Verify email spelling matches exactly  
3. Confirm password matches exactly
4. Check Supabase project URL in environment variables

### **If Tasks Don't Show:**
1. Verify UUID replacement in SQL script was done correctly
2. Check user profiles were created (SELECT * FROM profiles)
3. Confirm tasks were assigned to correct user IDs
4. Check notifications table for task assignments

### **If Team Members See Each Other's Tasks:**
1. Check Row Level Security policies are enabled
2. Verify task assignment used correct user IDs
3. Confirm frontend filtering by assignee_id

### **If Projects Don't Appear in PM Dashboard:**
1. Check projects table has project_manager_id = PM's UUID
2. Verify PM profile exists with role 'project_manager' 
3. Check frontend queries filter by assigned PM
